# DOM Pig Game
The DOM Pig Game is a simple game meant to strengthen general JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge. The idea of this game came from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course.

## The Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds, with the objective of getting a GLOBAL score of 100 points.
* Each player can roll the dice as many times as they wish during their turn and the result will be added to the ROUND score. However, if a player rolls a 1 on either of the dice, the ROUND score will go to 0 and it's the next player's turn.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', meaning their ROUND score is added to the GLOBAL score, which cannot be reset, and it's the next player's turn.
